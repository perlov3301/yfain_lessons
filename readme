I found the location... turns out that youtube stores downloads as BLOB files, so it's not like an .mp4 on your drive that you can just use for anything, which I guess makes sense, unfortunately.

But the location is dependent on which browser you're using. For example, on Windows using Brave browser, it's in: %localappdata%\BraveSoftware\Brave-Browser\User Data\Default\IndexedDB

And the actual folder will be called something like: https_www.youtube.com_0.indexeddb.blob
